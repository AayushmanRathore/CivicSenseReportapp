🏙️ Civic Reporting & Responding System

**Smart India Hackathon Project**

📌 What is this project?

A citizen-first app that makes it easy to report everyday civic problems like:

* 🚧 Potholes
* 🗑️ Garbage
* 💧 Waterlogging
* 💡 Streetlights

With just one tap, people can take a photo or video, and the app will:

* Capture the **location automatically**
* Fill in **user details**
* Categorize the issue using **icons or voice input** (supports multiple languages)

The home screen shows nearby complaints on a map (like *FixMyStreet*) to avoid duplicates.

Each complaint follows a **simple tracker**:
Registered → Assigned → In Progress → Resolved ✅

Citizens can also see before/after photos and give feedback (👍/👎).

To boost participation, the app includes **badges and leaderboards** (e.g., *Civic Hero of the Month*).

For officials, a smart dashboard provides:

* Complaint heatmaps
* Filters by ward/category
* Overdue alerts
* SLA-based prioritization

🎯 Why this matters

* Citizens get a **fast, transparent, and easy** way to report problems.
* Officials get a **data-driven dashboard** for accountability.
* Cities become **cleaner, safer, and more efficient**.
